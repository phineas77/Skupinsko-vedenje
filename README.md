**Starting point**
In the e-classroom, you can find several articles that are valuable resources for our project. Notably, ["Fuzzy Logic-Based Model That Incorporates Personality Traits for Heterogeneous Pedestrians"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/239) and ["Modeling of Crowd Evacuation With Assailants via a Fuzzy Logic Approach"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7442132). These articles illustrate practical applications of fuzzy logic. Although the application is to crowd control, they still provide a relevant aspect for our project, especially in the context of herding and behavior management. For a strong starting point on herding algorithms, ["Shepherding Heterogeneous Flock with Model-Based Discrimination"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11055.pdf) and [Optimal shepherding and transport of a flock](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04352.pdf) cover the core dynamics of agents and shepherds in herding scenarios, give good mathematacial background and overview of example implementation. Additionally, ["Behavior-Based Herding Algorithm for Social Force Model Based Sheep Herd"](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/2/285) helps by comparing different herding algorithms, which will be helpful in deciding for the most appropriate one. Initial goal also assumes searching for other articles to deepen our knowledge and lastly deciding on algorithm we want to improve. Latter consists of finding already existing solution or creating a new code baseline.
