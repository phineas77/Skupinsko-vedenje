# Using Fuzzy Logic to reimplement the FRIsheeping herding algorithm

Project report for Collective Behavior course at Faculty of Computer and Information Science at the University of Ljubljana.

### Code

Implementation is a forked repository of FRIsheeping, available [here](https://github.com/FyFean/frisheeping/). To run the simulation, you can clone the repository with git.

`git clone https://github.com/FyFean/frisheeping/`

Then you can import it to Unity Hub via "Add" button. The project can be run using the "Play" button inside Unity Editor. The project uses Unity version `2022.3.13f`.

### Overview

In this project, we extend the FRIsheeping project using fuzzy logic.

The following articles serve as a strong starting point on herding algorithms; ["Shepherding Heterogeneous Flock with Model-Based Discrimination"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11055.pdf) and [Optimal Shepherding and Transport of a Flock](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04352.pdf). In addition to the core dynamics of agents and shepherds in herding scenarios, these articles also provide some mathematical background and an overview of possible implementation methods.

Further information on the practical applications of fuzzy logic is covered in ["Fuzzy Logic-Based Model That Incorporates Personality Traits for Heterogeneous Pedestrians"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/239) and ["Modeling of Crowd Evacuation With Assailants via a Fuzzy Logic Approach"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7442132). Despite focusing mainly on crowd control, we still find some relevant information for our project, especially concerning herding and behavior management.
