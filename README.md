### Overview

In this project, we will reimplement the current FRIsheeping herding algorithm using fuzzy logic. If time allows we will also attempt to train the model using genetic algorithms.

The following articles serve as a strong starting point on herding algorithms; ["Shepherding Heterogeneous Flock with Model-Based Discrimination"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11055.pdf) and [Optimal Shepherding and Transport of a Flock](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04352.pdf). In addition to the core dynamics of agents and shepherds in herding scenarios, these articles also provide some mathematical background and an overview of possible implementation methods.

Further information on the practical applications of fuzzy logic is covered in ["Fuzzy Logic-Based Model That Incorporates Personality Traits for Heterogeneous Pedestrians"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/239) and ["Modeling of Crowd Evacuation With Assailants via a Fuzzy Logic Approach"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7442132). Despite focusing mainly on crowd control, we still find some relevant information for our project, especially concerning herding and behavior management.

Additionally, ["Behavior-Based Herding Algorithm for Social Force Model Based Sheep Herd"](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/2/285) compares different herding algorithms, which, when the time comes, will definitely help decide on an appropriate technique.

Our initial goal also assumes searching for additional articles to deepen our theoretical and practical knowledge in implementing herding algorithms.
